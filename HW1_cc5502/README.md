#Homework 1
##Assignmnt 1
- I paired up with Jianghao and we made changes with each other's repo starting with `gittest`. 
- A couple commits were executed under the name of my previous github account, and, after looking for resources online, I solved the problem such that the last commit was made under my name. I also sent him a pull request after aproving his request and merged the changes on my repo.
